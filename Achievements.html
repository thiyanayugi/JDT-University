    <h3 style="font-family:courier;">A college is said to thrive when the faculty and students produce results that are visible and about which the fraternity can be proud of. The milieu in the college is such that it encourages teachers to not only teach but also participate in activities that are enriching not only for themselves but also the students. The fact that teachers are conducting scientific research projects, involved in writing textbooks, developing content for the web, committed to teaching and learning tools that enable web upload, organizing and taking part in workshops that help update their subject knowledge, makes for an atmosphere very conducive to learning. In addition, a very active eco-club, NSS, SPICMACAY and Sashakt (Women's Student Affair Committee) ensure that students are involved in diverse activities that further the cause of these bodies.  

In view of the dynamic atmosphere of the college, it is not surprising when  both students and as well as faculty produce tangible results. The links provided take you to pages that specifically bring out the stellar performances of teachers and students over the last few years.</p>
